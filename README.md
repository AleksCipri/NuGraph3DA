This is a separate copy of the repo that includes the inclusion of Domain Adaptation for NuGraph3. This repo is still work in progress.

NuGraph is a graph neural network (GNN) for neutrino physics event reconstruction. This repository contains the source code for the following packages:
- [nugraph](nugraph/README.md) – module containing the GNN architecture and data loader
- [pynuml](pynuml/README.md) – module containing graph processing, truth labelling and visualization tools.
